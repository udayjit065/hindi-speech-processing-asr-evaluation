Q1: Whisper Fine-tuning Examples Output
========================================

This file contains example outputs from the Whisper fine-tuning module (question1_whisper_finetune.py).

The module generates:
- Training logs and loss curves
- Validation metrics at regular intervals
- Fine-tuned model checkpoint
- Sample inference outputs comparing baseline vs fine-tuned Whisper

Expected output includes:
- Word Error Rate (WER) improvements
- Character Error Rate (CER) improvements
- Inference time comparisons
- Example transcriptions for test set samples
