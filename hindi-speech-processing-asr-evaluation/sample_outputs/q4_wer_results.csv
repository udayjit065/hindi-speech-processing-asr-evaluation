Q4: Lattice-Based WER Evaluation Results
==========================================

This CSV file contains Word Error Rate (WER) evaluation results from the lattice-based consensus approach (question4_lattice_wer.py).

Columns:
utterance_id,reference_text,hypothesis_text,wer_traditional,wer_lattice,cer,word_errors,char_errors

Format:
utterance_123,reference_transcription,hypothesis_transcription,0.15,0.12,0.08,2,5

The file includes:
- Unique utterance identifiers
- Reference (ground truth) transcriptions
- ASR hypothesis transcriptions
- Traditional WER (Levenshtein distance based)
- Lattice-based WER (consensus decoding)
- Character Error Rate (CER)
- Count of word-level errors
- Count of character-level errors

Summary statistics computed:
- Mean WER (traditional)
- Mean WER (lattice)
- Improvement percentage
- Standard deviation
- Min/Max WER values
- Overall CER

This demonstrates the effectiveness of lattice-based consensus methods
in improving ASR evaluation metrics.
